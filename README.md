# nanoAkka

In microAkka I tried to implement the LightBend Akka framework almost literately , with the same verbs and concepts of : Actor , ActorRef, Dispatcher, .. But using messagetype detection in C++ required too much overhead in code 

Later on I worked with Akka streams and reactive programming concepts, which led to the project esp32-streams. There I still struggled with the combination

An even smaller actor C++ framework based on ideas of Akka, Streams and Wiring
